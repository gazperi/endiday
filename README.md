# Endiday

Sometimes the number of days remaining seemed like a complicated measure for me. For some reason, I can better understand the amount of time I have as a percentage and this makes it easier to organize my work and my life in general. Endday is my personal project to keep these dates in the spotlight. I take care of it with great affection and update whenever possible. I welcome suggestions, new ideas and feedback. I would love for other users who like to measure time in percentages, as I do, to share their thoughts with me.
