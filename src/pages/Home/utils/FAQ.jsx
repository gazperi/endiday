    title: 'Can I make a financial contribution to the project?',
    description:
      "For now, No. But on future, all the money received to help Nowtee goes towards its development. I have a philosophy of only getting paid by Nowtee if it's through plans paid by users, not donations. The donations are to accelerate the development of the project.",

    description:
      "As mentioned before, of a necessity of mine. I still use calendars and to-do lists as usual. But I've always missed a stop to show me how much time is left until my block of time ends. No longer in hours, in percentage.",
